# Accessibility Templates

This is a repository of templates/demonstrations of generating accessible documents from markup languages like LaTeX and Markdown. The main tools used are the excellent [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) and GNU Make. Both are easy to install on most platforms. Tagged PDF generation is accomplished using ConTeXt. It is a little harder to install.
