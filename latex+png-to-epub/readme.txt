Instructions for using this template.

1. Create an empty directory for the document.

2. Copy this template (lectureN.tex and Makefile) and any png files into the directory created in step 1.

3. Open your terminal application and change the the directory created in step 1.

4. Type 'make' (without the quotes) and press return. This should create the html file, which you can view in your browser by typing 'open lectureN.html'

Note: you can name the tex file whatever you like as long as it ends in .tex. You do not have to update the Makefile.

You can make changes in any plain text editor. Save the changes. Typing make in the terminal will regenerate the html file.

You can also just drop new or updated png files intp the directory and run make again. It will detect the new files and regenerate the html if needed.
